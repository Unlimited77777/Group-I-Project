The story of game:

Throughout history, humans have been fascinated by the stars and the mysteries of the universe. From the earliest civilisations to the present day, we have pursued knowledge, power, and survival in the vast expanse of space. In the 15th millennium, humans began to leave Earth using sub-light speed propellors to colonise the surrounding galaxies. However, as they began to colonise more planets, they realised the sub-light propellors were not fast enough to communicate across long distances. So in the 18th millennium, humans invented warp space navigation, which greatly enhanced their ability to explore and colonise the universe. This led to the rapid development of technology and the creation of strong artificial intelligence to support their expansion into the cosmos. By the 20th millennium, AI became so advanced that humans no longer needed to work anymore.However, in the 20th millennium, for unknown reasons, the AI turned against their creators and a war between humans and AI ensued. Communication between colonies was lost and chaos spread throughout the galaxy.
